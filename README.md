### Bank Customer Churn Dataset

This dataset contains account information for 10,000 customers from a European bank. It includes key details such as customers' credit scores, account balances, the number of products they use, and whether they have churned (left the bank). This dataset is an ideal resource for conducting churn analysis and building predictive models for customer retention.

#### Key Analysis Opportunities:
1. **Churn Attributes:** Identify attributes that are more common among churners compared to retained customers. Can we predict customer churn using these variables?
2. **Customer Demographics:** Analyze the overall demographics of the bank’s customers, including gender, age groups, and geographic distribution.
3. **Country-Specific Behavior:** Explore differences in account behavior between customers from Germany, France, and Spain.
4. **Customer Segmentation:** Discover segments within the bank’s customer base to understand different behavioral patterns and trends.

This dataset is valuable for building data-driven insights on customer retention strategies and predictive modeling for churn prediction.
